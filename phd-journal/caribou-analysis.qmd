glimpse(locations)

visdat::vis_dat(individuals)
visdat::vis_dat(locations, warn_large_data = FALSE)
```

The variable that does not contain NA in the individuals data are sex and study_site.

```{r}
# Joining the data
caribou <- individuals |> 
    select(animal_id, sex) |> 
    distinct(animal_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
    right_join(locations, by = "animal_id") |> 
    mutate(
        sex = factor(sex, levels = c("f", "m"), labels = c("female", "male"))
    )
```


## Question

- Is there any different between the winter and summer movement?
- Does caribou from different study site have the same movement pattern?
