    "text": "2.1 Graphical discovery in stochastic actor-oriented models for social network analysis - Chapter 4\nMany R packages can manipulate network objects. However, they mainly focused on analysing network data and not necessarily on rendering visualisations of networks. Visualising network data using packages such as igraph, sna, and network requires a lot of extra work if one is accustomed to working with a data structure like vectors, data frames, or arrays. This chapter provides three different approaches to network visualisation through ggplot2 wrappers. The first is a function, ggnet2, from the ggally package that acts as a wrapper around a network object to create ggplot2 graph. The second package, geomnet, combines all network pieces (nodes, edges, and labels) into a single geom and is intended to look the most like other ggplot2 geoms in use. The final package, ggnetwork, performs some data manipulation and aliases other geoms to layer the different network aspects one on top of the other. Each of these approaches also has different ways of dealing with the data structure.",
