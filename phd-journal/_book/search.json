    "text": "2.1 Graphical discovery in stochastic actor-oriented models for social network analysis - Chapter 4\nMany R packages can manipulate network objects. However, they mainly focused on analysing network data and not necessarily on rendering visualisations of networks. Visualising network data using packages such as igraph, sna, and network requires much extra work if one is used to working with a data structure like vectors, data frames, or arrays. This chapter provides three different approaches to network visualisation through ggplot2 wrappers. The first is a function, ggnet2, from the ggally package that acts as a wrapper around a network object to create a ggplot2 graph. The second package, geomnet, combines all network pieces (nodes, edges, and labels) into a single geom and is intended to look the most like other ggplot2 geoms in use. The final package, ggnetwork, performs some data manipulation and aliases other geoms to layer the different network aspects on top of the other. Each of these packages also has different ways of dealing with the data structure.\nFor geomnet, it combines two sources of information, node description and the relationship between nodes (vertices), into one dataset using the fortify s3 methods. The supported classes are “network” from sna and network packages, “igraph” from the igraph package, “adjmat”, and “edgedf” (classes from geomnet). It is then passed on to the ggplot2 to draw the network data. On the other hand, ggnet2 and ggnetwork internally translate a network object into a data frame suitable for plotting with ggplot2, then apply network-related aesthetic operations to that data frame.",
