## Graphical discovery in stochastic actor-oriented models for social network analysis - Chapter 4

Many R packages can manipulate network objects. However, they mainly focused on analysing network data and not necessarily on rendering visualisations of networks. Visualising network data using packages such as **igraph**, **sna**, and **network** requires a lot of extra work if one is accustomed to working with a data structure like vectors, data frames, or arrays. This chapter provides three different approaches to network visualisation through **ggplot2 wrappers**. The first is a function, **ggnet2**, from the **ggally** package that acts as a wrapper around a network object to create **ggplot2** graph. The second package, **geomnet**, combines all network pieces (nodes, edges, and labels) into a single **geom** and is intended to look the most like other **ggplot2 geoms** in use. The final package, **ggnetwork**, performs some data manipulation and aliases other **geoms** to layer the different network aspects one on top of the other. Each of these approaches also has different ways of dealing with the data structure.
